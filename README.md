Travelling Birds is your ultimate travel companion, designed to simplify and enrich your travel experiences. The platform offers personalized travel planning tailored to your interests, seamless booking for flights, hotels, and transportation, and budgeting tools to ensure stress-free planning. Discover curated local gems, enjoy expert-guided itineraries, and stay informed with real-time notifications for your bookings and events. Complete your journey with exclusive souvenirs from our in-app gift shop. Travelling Birds combines convenience, personalization, and discovery to make every trip unforgettable.

## Motivation
Travel planning can often feel overwhelming, with countless websites, apps, and recommendations to navigate. We created Travelling Birds to bridge the gap between personalization and convenience in trip planning. Inspired by platforms like TripAdvisor, our aim is to offer a one-stop solution that caters to all travel needs from booking and budgeting to exploring local gems and managing itineraries.

We were motivated by the desire to help travelers save time, reduce stress, and focus on enjoying their adventures. Whether you're a seasoned traveler or planning your first trip, Travelling Birds ensures every journey is seamless and memorable.

## Build Status
The project is fully developed and operational. All core features, including personalized travel planning, seamless booking, budgeting tools, curated local gems, tour guide itineraries, gift shop, and real-time notifications, have been successfully implemented and tested.

#### Known Issues:
* Occasional delays in real-time notifications for low-bandwidth networks.
* User preferences are not tied to explore page.
* Ocassional delays in loading pages due to size of database and images.

##  Code Style
The project adheres to the following coding styles:

* Frontend (React): JavaScript follows the StandardJS style guide for clean and consistent code.
* CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS components are used to maintain a consistent and modular design system.
* Backend (Node.js): Code follows ESLint configuration aligned to the Airbnb Style Guide.

All contributors are encouraged to follow these styles to ensure uniformity and maintainability throughout the project.
